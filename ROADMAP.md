# Here are a list of improvements that could be made if this were a real project:

- Allow users to register in order to keep a longer history of their conversions.
- Allow more currencies.
- Poll the currencies properly from an external API instead of hardcoding them.
- The website currently supports english and french. We could support more languages.
- Allow exporting previous conversions as CSV or PDF.
