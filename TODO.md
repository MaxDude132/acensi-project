Notes about this project.

**This project was started from my personal template that I use for React projects.**
**As such, some (or many) files in this project are not directly related to the project itself.**
**To see the important file, please refer to the `src/routes/index.tsx` file.**

I believe I managed to implemented everything that was asked of me.

Here are a list of improvements that could be made if this were a real project:
- Allow users to register in order to keep a longer history of their conversions.
- Allow more currencies.
- Poll the currencies properly from an external API instead of hardcoding them.
- The website currently supports english and french. We could support more languages.
- Allow exporting previous conversions as CSV or PDF.
